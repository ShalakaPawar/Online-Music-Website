00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.950
He said, "Let's get out of this town,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.550
Drive out of the city, away
from the crowds."

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.650
I thought heaven can't help me now.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.950
Nothing lasts forever, but
this is gonna take me down

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.750
He's so tall and handsome as hell

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.250
He's so bad but he does it so well

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.550
I can see the end as it begins

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.050
My one condition is

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.450
Say you'll remember me

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.550
Standing in a nice dress,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.050
Staring at the sunset, babe

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.350
Red lips and rosy cheeks

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.350
Say you'll see me again

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.950
Even if it's just in your

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.650
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.850
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.450
I said, "No one has to know
what we do, "

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
His hands are in my hair, his
clothes are in my room

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.350
And his voice is a familiar sound,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.050
Nothing lasts forever but this
is getting good now

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.950
He's so tall and handsome as hell

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.650
He's so bad but he does it so well

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.950
And when we've had our very last kiss

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.550
My last request it is

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.150
Say you'll remember me

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.650
Standing in a nice dress,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.350
Staring at the sunset, babe

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.450
Red lips and rosy cheeks

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.450
Say you'll see me again

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.550
Even if it's just in your

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.750
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.750
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.550
You see me in hindsight

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.350
Tangled up with you all night

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.250
Burning it down

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.250
Someday when you leave me

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.150
I bet these memories

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.350
Follow you around

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.150
You'll see me in hindsight

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.950
Tangled up with you all night

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.250
Burning it down

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.050
Someday when you leave me

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.750
I bet these memories

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.750
Follow you around

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.050
Say you'll remember me

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.850
Standing in a nice dress,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.550
Staring at the sunset, babe

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.850
Red lips and rosy cheeks

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.650
Say you'll see me again

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.150
Even if it's just pretend

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.050
Say you'll remember me

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.250
Standing in a nice dress,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.050
Staring at the sunset, babe

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.150
Red lips and rosy cheeks

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.150
Say you'll see me again

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.350
Even if it's just in your (
just pretend, just pretend)

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.450
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.050
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.550
(Even if it's just in your
wildest dreams) ah-ha

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.750
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.
